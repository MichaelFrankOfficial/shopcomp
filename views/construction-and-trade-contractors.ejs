                <p class="industry-p">Workers&rsquo; compensation premiums are calculated, in part, by the kinds of work performed. Many businesses
                    have multiple functions performed by different kinds of employees - others have just a few people who
                    wear many different hats. It&rsquo;s important to classify employees accurately - based on what they
                    spend the majority of their time doing - because this could alter your premium dramatically.</p>
                <h3 class="industry-h3">What to Know</h3>
                <ul class="industry-p">
                    <li>Construction and trade contractors are unique in the way their jobsites, co-workers and employers change
                        with each job they work on, which can make it difficult to understand the limits of a workers&rsquo;
                        compensation policy.</li>
                    <li>Subcontractors are the liability of the general contractor, unless they carry their own workers&rsquo;
                        compensation insurance. General contractors must cover subcontractors under their work comp policy,
                        or require subcontractors to show proof of insurance before stepping on the jobsite.</li>
                    <li>Because it is very physically demanding, construction businesses and trade contractors are higher risk
                        compared to other industries.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3 class="industry-h3">Potential Hazards</h3>
                <ul class="industry-p">
                    <li>Heavy equipment, dangerous tools, heights and working outdoors can all make for potentially hazardous
                        working conditions. The construction and trade contractors industry is diverse, ranging from the
                        highly risky roofing jobs to relatively safe plumbing operations.</li>
                    <li>Working at heights above 15 feet, on roofs or in trenches will make your business a greater risk.</li>
                    <li>
                        If you perform work outdoors, your level of risk could vary depending on your state&rsquo;s climate and weather patterns
                        (extreme heat, snow, natural disasters).</li>
                </ul>
                <h3 class="industry-h3">Factors That Impact Coverage</h3>
                <ul class="industry-p">

                        from coverage but have the option to include yourself.&nbsp;</li>
                    <li>
                        You are a corporate officer:&nbsp;You are considered an employee and included in coverage; however you may exclude yourself
                        under certain circumstances.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3 class="industry-h3">About Work Class Codes</h3>
                <p class="industry-p">Many businesses have several work class codes that describe what their employees do. It&rsquo;s important
                    to classify each group of employees accurately because it could alter your premium dramatically.</p>
                <h3 class="industry-h3">Construction &amp; Trade Contractors Work Class Codes</h3>

                <p class="industry-p">If you employ workers in multiple states or your employees are temporarily working out-of-state, you need
                    to purchase insurance for all the states where your workers are located, according to each state&rsquo;s
                    laws.
