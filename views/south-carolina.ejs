                        across state lines to work, you may need to modify your policy to guarantee coverage in the event

                        write workers' compensation policies in any U.S. state except those that practice state-run workers'
                        compensation (Ohio, Washington, North Dakota and Wyoming).&nbsp;

                </h3>
                <p class="states-work-comp-p">If you employ workers in multiple states or your employees are temporarily working out-of-state, you need
                    to purchase insurance for all the states where your workers are located, according to each state&rsquo;s
                    laws.

                    <br />The nature of your business, number of employees being covered and past coverage and claims are all factors
